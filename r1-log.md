## Log

### R1D0 [Sep 12th 2024]
Started looking into countries api app https://prernalele.github.io/countries-api-main/ 
Problems : Need to look into the theme switcher.

### R1D1 [Sep 13th 2024]
 I had recently used this tutorial to learn how to use context API : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAcI_FdfkA8. 
 So I started with using the same context in passing the "theme" data. Today I only did the ground work
But tomorrow I will make the switcher working
Today's commit : https://github.com/prernalele/countries-api-main/commit/b3775395a7d03a4120e53d7473e2b261c692631a

### R1D2 [Sep 14th 2024]
Today I was able to make the mode/theme switcher functional.  Also made changes to ReadMe
Commit : https://github.com/prernalele/countries-api-main/commit/34f5ce5e855e97a70c67ef1ed37524b34198b608
Thoughts/TODOs : 
The light theme is all over the place currently and would need some fixing.

### R1D3 [Sep 15th 2024]
Finding a bit challenging to make the light mode theme work the way it should. I am passing the theme not as props but using useContext. But the way I am doing isn't DRY so far. 
commit: https://github.com/prernalele/countries-api-main/commit/b65817c34346bd7932300d29d0ccdca2d720cf5b  
Thoughts/TODOs : 
1. The light theme is all over the place currently and would need some fixing.
2. May be I can revisit the tutorial and see what I might be missing. 
3. Observed some other bugs with search bar. 
4. Need to fix the Filter as well
5. The theme should also be saved so it doesn't go away if the user refreshes the page.

### R1D4 [Sep 16 2024]
Day 4 of #100DaysOfCode 

Tried Ironing out the light theme some more. Commit : https://github.com/prernalele/countries-api-main/commit/907b0c8aa6df37da4079b0cda6b9832e6adcc10c

 Definitly a work in progress. Also realizing that the site deployed on github pages isn't picking up the changes when I push changes to github. So right now these changes aren't here https://prernalele.github.io/countries-api-main/ 

Thoughts : 

1. the Cards don't look like the design yet. 
2. I didn't actually spend 2 hours doing this, but I am calling it a win for today.
