## Log

### R1D0
Started looking into countries api app https://prernalele.github.io/countries-api-main/ 
Problems : Need to look into the theme switcher.

### R1D1 
 I had recently used this tutorial to learn how to use context API : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAcI_FdfkA8. 
 So I started with using the same context in passing the "theme" data. Today I only did the ground work
But tomorrow I will make the switcher working
Today's commit : https://github.com/prernalele/countries-api-main/commit/b3775395a7d03a4120e53d7473e2b261c692631a

### R1D2
Today I was able to make the mode/theme switcher functional.  Also made changes to ReadMe
Commit : https://github.com/prernalele/countries-api-main/commit/34f5ce5e855e97a70c67ef1ed37524b34198b608
Thoughts/TODOs : 
The light theme is all over the place currently and would need some fixing.
